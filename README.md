# VLArena: Integrating End-to-End Multimodal Models with Closed-loop Generative Simulation for Autonomous Driving

## Abstract 📄

VLArena integrates the End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving (EMMA) with the DriveArena simulation platform to advance autonomous driving research. By combining EMMA's capability to process raw sensor data into driving-specific outputs with DriveArena's high-fidelity, closed-loop simulation environment, VLArena enables the development and evaluation of autonomous driving agents in realistic and interactive scenarios. Additionally, this project has open-sourced a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data auto-labeling pipeline tool, streamlining the annotation process for complex datasets. This integration facilitates comprehensive testing and refinement of autonomous driving models, promoting safer and more efficient autonomous vehicle technologies.
